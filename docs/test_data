Nadam
=====

keras.optimizers.Nadam(lr=0.002, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=1e-08, schedule_decay=0.004)

Nesterov Adam optimizer.

Much like Adam is essentially RMSprop with momentum, Nadam is Adam RMSprop with Nesterov momentum.

Default parameters follow those provided in the paper. It is recommended to leave the parameters of this optimizer at their default values.

Arguments

    lr: float >= 0. Learning rate.
    beta_1/beta_2: floats, 0 < beta < 1. Generally close to 1.
    epsilon: float >= 0. Fuzz factor.


h5 format
=========

 This confused me to start off with too. Basically the filetype is already of `h5` type, so all you have to do is add the `.h5` extension when you set the file name.
shreeyak 8 days ago
Yeah, adding the extension isn't even necessary. It just runs.


Callback
========

tensorBoard_cb = keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs/model1c')
# checkpoint
filepath="./saved_chkpts/model1c/weights-improvement-{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}.h5"
checkpoint_cb = keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(filepath, monitor='val_loss', verbose=1, period=1)
callbacks = [tensorBoard_cb, checkpoint_cb]
